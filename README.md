> A simple and lazy file-to-toplevel loader for OCAML

This project is VERY VERY VERY lazy, i just wanted an extension to load my file into my toplevel and i didn't find one online, it only works if you have `ocaml` installed under the `ocaml` command. 
Use it at your own risks if you want. The code is ugly and a plain modification of the default hello-world-template of vsc extensions.

It adds a run icon on the menu AND the status bar, the command is labeled `loadInToplevel` and is keybinded with `ctrl+t` (`cmd+t` on macs ) by default.
